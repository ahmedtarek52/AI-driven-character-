🧠 AI Implementation & Speech Recognition
This game leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Speech-to-Text AI to create an intelligent and immersive experience.

📌 How It Works:
1️⃣ Speech Recognition: Player voice is captured and processed using LLM-based speech-to-text models (Qwen 2.05 / LLaMA 3.1).
2️⃣ Command Filtering: The AI determines if the speech is a combat command or personality interaction.
3️⃣ Personality AI: Henry Carter responds to non-combat dialogue naturally, reflecting his personality and background.
4️⃣ Function Execution: If a command is detected, it triggers the correct in-game function (e.g., "Use Fireball" activates the skill).

🤖 LLM Processing & Command Handling
AI dynamically decides responses based on context.

Separate LLMs for personality & combat commands to prevent response mixing.

Strict command filtering ensures only valid actions are executed.

🛠 Technologies Used
🎮 Game Development
✔ Unity 3D – Game Engine.
✔ C# – Core scripting language.
✔ NavMesh AI – Pathfinding and enemy movement.

🗣 AI & Speech Recognition
✔ LLMCharacter – AI-driven personality interactions.
✔ Hugging Face API – Speech-to-Text processing.
✔ Qwen 2.05 & LLaMA 3.1 – AI models for command execution & dialogue.

📌 How to Play
1️⃣ Start the game and use voice commands to interact.
2️⃣ Move Henry freely & switch perspectives (FPS/TPS) click (1/2).
3️⃣ Engage in combat using voice commands (Fireball, Shield, Targeting).
4️⃣ Defeat both enemies using strategy and skill timing.

📢 Future Enhancements
🚀 More AI-Driven Interactions – Expanding Henry’s personality responses.
🚀 New Skills & Enemies – Adding more combat depth.
🚀 Advanced Tactical AI – Smarter enemy behaviors & counterattacks.

👨‍💻 Developer Notes
This game was built as a fusion of AI & gaming, demonstrating how LLMs and speech-to-text can create immersive and interactive gameplay. It explores the future of AI-driven gaming, where characters respond naturally and intelligently to player inputs.

Enjoy playing! 🎮🔥
